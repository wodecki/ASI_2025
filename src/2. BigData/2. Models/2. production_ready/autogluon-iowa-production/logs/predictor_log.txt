train_data with frequency 'IRREG' has been resampled to frequency 'D'.
Provided train_data has 4355 rows (NaN fraction=18.0%), 5 time series. Median time series length is 871 (min=871, max=871). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'total_amount_sold'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
